<h1>Welcome to our ZOO! </h1>
Hello 2023 Interns! Below is a comprehensive list of all our our animals and a brief description of their personalities
so that you can get to know them before they get to know you! Please click on the individual links because first and foremost they are ANIMALS and follow said traits of their species.</h1>

          <h2>Bears</h2>
          <ol>1. Ollie</ol>
<p> Ollie has been in our posession since spring 2014, He loves to lay in the sun and hates the rain. His favorite time of the day is of course lunch time but be aware that sometimes he likes to steal lunch from his best friend Mona.</p>

        <ol>2. Mona</ol>
         <p> You might struggle to differentiate between the two of them. The male (Ollie) is bigger and his head appears to be smaller in comparison to his body. Mona appears to have shorter legs and is a bit more squat in appearance, its somewhat subtle. The main difference is that Mona tries to be super friendly. She might have been a golden retriever in her past life but dont let that fool you, She can cause a lot of damage!</p>

<h2>Giraffes</h2>
<ol>1. Frankie</ol>
<p>Giraffes are traditionally found in the dry savannahs of Africa, where they roam among the open plains. They are known for their long necks, they are the worlds tallest living land animals. Frankie is very friendly and will often bow her head down looking for pets. 
    Do not be alarmed! She only eats plants!</p>

                    <h2>Lions</h2>
                    <ol>1. Mellie</ol>
<p>Mellie has been in our zoo since 2019. Lions are generally very lazy animals and spend about 20 hours a day sleeping. Mellie rarely gets up for anything other than meal time. Do not be alarmed if she does not move during your whole shift.</p>

                    <ol>2. Karl</ol> 
                    </li>
                    <p>Karl can often be seen sleeping in the vicinity of Mellie. In the wild they are apex predators but Karl has been with us since he was a cub and 
                        although his teeth and claws are VERY sharp he has never hunted anything and has been occasionally spooked by his own shadow.</p>

<h2>Monkeys</h2>
<ol>1. Cookie (left)</ol>
<ol>2. Earl (middle)</ol>
<ol>3. Banana Pudding (right)</ol>

<p> Monkeys are omnivores and eat mostly eggs, nuts, seeds, and fruits. You will notice a varying combination of foods throughout their day. Some days they will even eat
    insects, lizards, etc. Monkeys are social creatures and spend a lot of time interacting with one another. Thats why its so hard to photograph them sepatately! Try not to spend too much time in their enclosure because they like to throw things. 
    They are overall not hostile and will not try to cause you harm.. but they still can! </p>

     <h2>Alligators</h2>

     
     <ol>1. Wren</ol>
     <p>Frankly, when it comes down to the alligators you never want to be close enough to figure out who is who. The American Alligator can grow to be almost 18 feet and most days we dont believe Wren only clocks in around 15.65 feet. 
        Dont let her size fool you, she is incredibly fast both in and out of the water. Shes been in our facility since she was hatched. Alligators have a lifespan of about 35-50 years if they are given a chance to hatch. 
        Cannibalism is huge among alligators which you would be surpised to hear considering how many live in Louisiana and Florida.

     <ol>2. Aspen</ol>
     <p> Aspen is much smaller than Wren and spends most of his time in the water. Due to his lack of chubby cheeks (as seen on Wren) people sometimes confuse him for a crocodile. 
        See below link to learn the difference between the two! Our facility does not have any crocodiles!</p>

       <ol>3. Mika</ol>
     <p>Mika was acquired in late 2019 after working as an Emotinoal Support Alligator at the New Orleans Airport. Hes much bigger now and we do not reccomend trying to pet him. 
        You can however read the article about his history below</p>
